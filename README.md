# Dataset-for-Electrical-Fault-Diagnosis-using-Vibration-Signals
The dataset employed in this study is dedicated to detecting electrical faults by analyzing vibration signals. It is a valuable resource for investigating and identifying anomalies within electrical systems.
# Record-2_n and Record-5_n
This n suffixed represents the normal dataset without any faults.
# Record-4_lg and Record-2_ll
These two datasets represent line-to-ground and line-to-line faults respectively. This data was collected when fault severity was 50%.
# Record-6_ll(75%) and Record-3_lg(75%)
These two datasets represent line-to-line faults and line-to-ground respectively. This data was collected when fault severity was 75%.
# IV_Data_Generator
This dataset is used for the fault classification using current signals.
